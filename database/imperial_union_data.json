Some of our more skilled members have ventured on expeditions as far as Georgia, India, and Vietnam with their kayaks! The best way to see what ICCC has to offer is at our weekly pool sessions on Tuesday evenings at Ethos. You can get to grips with the basics or improve your freestyle tricks, then finish off with a few games of canoe polo. We then head to the Union for a pint or two after.
