It's important to be aware of the types of scams being run. Examples of scams Discounted Tuition Fees You may be contacted by a person or organisation who is offering to pay for your Tier 4 Visa, Tuition Fee Deposit or Tuition Fees at a discounted rate, and in return will be asked to pay the fraudsters directly for this service. This could be advertised as either a one-off discount or an extremely generous exchange rate. The payments these fraudsters make for fees will be made via compromised card details which are later recalled by the original card holder as a charge back, leaving the applicant or student with an outstanding amount as well as the loss of money paid to the scammers. You may be shown a receipt or asked to log into your portal as evidence of payment however once the payment is recalled this proof of payment is no longer valid. Please always use a trusted source when making payment. Imperial College London's preferred payment methods can be found on our How to pay page. If you have any questions about this scam, or suspect you may have been targeted, please contact our Accounts Receivable team at studentpay.queries@imperial.ac.uk.

This involves a fraudulent invoice from an email address similar to ours (e.g. imperiai.ac.uk with a capital \"i\" instead of \"l\" at the end of \"imperiai\") being issued with different bank details to our own. If possible, please pay by card or e-payment, or if you need to pay by bank transfer, always validate the details against our How to pay page first or contact studentpay.queries@imperial.ac.uk for confirmation.

    "content": "Home Imperial students Fees and funding Undergraduate funding Loans and grants Tuition fee loan Tuition fee loan EU fee rates from 2021 EU students will no longer be able to claim tuition fee loans or the lower EU fee rates for programmes starting from 2021. Continuing students, who commence prior to 2021, will retain their fees and funding for the duration of the programme. Introduction to student finance in 2022/23 No fees upfront If you are a Home student, you can apply for a Tuition Fee Loan from the UK government. This will cover the entire cost of tuition for every year of study, which means you do not have to pay any money towards your fees while you are studying. The loan is not means-tested so, unlike the Maintenance Loan for living costs, it doesn't matter what your household income is. At Imperial, the undergraduate tuition fee for Home students at the College is \u00a39,250 for the 2023-24 academic year. Tuition Fees for contnuing Home students will remain at \u00a39,250 per year for 2023-24 entry. Do I have to pay it back? Yes, but only once you have left university, are in employment and earning above the repayment threshold. Tuition fee loan FAQs How does it work? The funding authority for your region (e.g. Student Finance England for students living in England) pays your Tuition Fee Loan directly to the College to cover the cost of your tuition for every year that you apply for the loan. The money is paid to the College in three installments over the course of each academic year. How do I apply? The application process varies depending on whether you are from England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Do I have to pay it back? Yes, but only once you have left university, are in employment and earning a pre-tax salary of \u00a326,575 a year or more (confirmed for English students but not Welsh students yet).
