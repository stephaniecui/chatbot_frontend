For Windows:
1. Save the Windows script as `set_env.bat` in your project directory.
2. To run the script and set the environment variables, open a Command Prompt in your project directory and type:
   ```
   set_env.bat
   ```
3. After running the script, you can start your Python application in the same Command Prompt window.

For Mac/Linux:
1. Save the Mac/Linux script as `set_env.sh` in your project directory.
2. Make the script executable by running this command in Terminal:
   ```
   chmod +x set_env.sh
   ```
3. To run the script and set the environment variables, use the source command in Terminal:
   ```
   source set_env.sh
   ```
4. After running the script, you can start your Python application in the same Terminal window.

General instructions for both systems:
1. After setting the environment variables using the appropriate script, you can run your Impy application. Assuming your main Python file is named `impy.py`, you would run:
   ```
   python impy.py
   ```
2. Make sure you have all the necessary Python packages installed. You can install them using pip:
   ```
   pip install azure-search-documents azure-identity openai
   ```
3. Remember that the environment variables set by these scripts only persist for the current terminal session. If you close the terminal or command prompt, you'll need to run the script again before running your application.

4. For security reasons, avoid committing these scripts with real credentials to version control. You might want to add them to your `.gitignore` file.

5. If you're using an IDE like PyCharm or VS Code, you can configure the environment variables in the run configuration instead of using these scripts.

By following these steps, you should be able to set up your environment and run Impy on both Windows and Mac/Linux systems. Let me know if you need any clarification or have any questions about the setup process!
